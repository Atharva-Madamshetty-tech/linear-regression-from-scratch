# Linear Regression from Scratch

---

##  Why This Repository?

Most machine learning tutorials use **Scikit-learn** or other high-level libraries that hide the mathematical implementation details. This repository takes a **fundamentals-first approach**, implementing every algorithm from scratch using only Python and NumPy.

**Learning Philosophy:**
-  **Mathematics First**: Understand calculus and linear algebra behind each algorithm
-  **Implementation Mastery**: Build cost functions, gradients, and optimizers manually  
-  **Real-World Applications**: Apply concepts to genuine datasets
-  **Deep Understanding**: Know how each parameter affects model performance

##  Mathematical Foundations

**Linear Regression Equation**  
- Single variable: `y = wx + b`  
- Multiple variables: `y = w₁x₁ + ... + wₙxₙ + b`  

**Cost Function (Mean Squared Error)**  
- J(w,b) = (1/2m) × Σ (h(xᵢ) - yᵢ)²

  
**Gradient Descent Algorithm**  
- Repeat until convergence:
- w = w - α × (∂J/∂w)
- b = b - α × (∂J/∂b)


**Gradient Calculations**  
- Single variable:  
- ∂J/∂w = (1/m) × Σ(predicted - actual) × x
- ∂J/∂b = (1/m) × Σ(predicted - actual)

- Multiple variables:  
- ∂J/∂wⱼ = (1/m) × Σ(predicted - actual) × xⱼ
- ∂J/∂b = (1/m) × Σ(predicted - actual)
